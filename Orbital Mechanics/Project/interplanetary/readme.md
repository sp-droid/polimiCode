# Specific requirements

**GROUP ID**: 2204	
**Departure**: Earth	
**Flyby planet**: Saturn	
**Arrival NEO**: 85	
**Earliest Departure**: 30-September-2026	
**Latest Arrival**: 28-March-2061

# General requirements

- Use the method of patched conics
- Do not consider planetary departure and insertion, that is:
  - Initial heliocentric orbit is equal to that of the departure planet
  - Final heliocentric orbit is equal to that of the arrival asteroid
- Use uplanet (in WeBeep) to compute the ephemerides of planets, and ephNEO (in WeBeep) for the ephemerides of NEOs (see comments in the code for names of NEOs)
- The figure of merit for the mission is the total cost in terms of Δ𝑣tot
  - Other criteria should be taken into account, such as altitude restrictions during the flyby

# General outputs

The mission analysis should cover the following points:

1. Design process, detailing:
	- Initial choice for the time windows, justifying it based on the characteristics of the mission
		- Do not just take the whole time interval provided in the mission requirements for both departure and arrival windows. Choose and justify them based on the characteristics of your mission.
	- Additional constraints considered (such as minimum altitude of the closest approach during the flyby)
	- Strategy followed to explore, analyze and compare the different transfer options
	- Justified selection of a final solution
	- Plots and data supporting your design choices (e.g., 𝛥𝑉 cost plots, preliminary estimates,… )
2. Final solution, including:
	- Heliocentric trajectory
		- Departure, flyby, and arrival times
		- Characterization of the interplanetary transfer arcs
		- Plot of the heliocentric trajectory, together with the orbits of the three celestial objects and their positions at departure, flyby, and arrival
	- Flyby (powered gravity assist)
		- Altitude of the closest approach
		- Time duration of the flyby (considering a finite SOI)
		- Comparison of the total velocity change due to the flyby Δ𝑣fb with the cost of the powered maneuver at perigee Δ𝑣ga
		- Plot of the incoming and outcoming hyperbola arcs
	- Cost of the mission in terms of 𝚫𝒗𝐭𝐨𝐭
		- Detail the separate values of Δ𝑣dep, Δ𝑣ga, and Δ𝑣arr
